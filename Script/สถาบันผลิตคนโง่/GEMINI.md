# Directory Overview: Podcast "สถาบันผลิตคนโง่" (The Institute for Producing Fools)

This directory contains the source scripts for a 10-part podcast series. The project is non-code and focuses entirely on content creation.

The central theme is a satirical and critical examination of the commercialization of Buddhism and religious institutions in modern Thai society. The podcast argues that many temples have strayed from spiritual teachings and instead operate like businesses, preying on the fear and greed of followers.

## Key Files

*   `คำสั่ง.txt`: This file contains the original prompt and detailed instructions for generating the podcast series. It outlines the structure, tone, length, and themes for each of the 10 episodes.
*   `01.txt` - `10.txt`: These files are the individual scripts for each episode of the podcast. Each file represents a part of a continuous narrative, designed to be read aloud or used with a Text-to-Speech (TTS) program.

## Usage

The primary purpose of this directory is to store and organize the scripts for the podcast. The content is intended to be recorded as audio episodes. The files are structured for easy use with TTS software, as they contain no parenthetical sound-effect descriptions, and the narrative flows naturally for audio presentation.
