Hello, my dear listeners... and welcome to a new journey. A journey where we won't be heading to any destination on the world map... but will instead turn inward... to begin exploring the most wondrous land of all... a land closer to us than our own breath...

Welcome to the podcast... **"Lessons from the World Behind the Eyelids."**

This is a podcast that won't invite you to conquer Mount Everest or dive into the Mariana Trench... but will invite you to become an adventurer in the universe hidden behind the curtain of our own eyes... a vast kingdom... both mysterious and, regrettably, forgotten.

In an age where the outside world spins at a breathtaking pace... with the lights from smartphone screens... the notification sounds from a hundred apps... and the torrent of information crashing upon us like giant ocean waves... our eyes are used relentlessly... to look "outward"... to perceive... to process... to decide... and to react to stimuli that never cease, not even for a fraction of a second.

We are all busy managing the external world... so much so that sometimes... or perhaps, often... we may forget... that there is another world, patiently and silently awaiting our return... a world that doesn't demand attention... that doesn't make a loud noise... but holds all the secrets of our entire being.

Right here, right now... I would like to ask for your permission to stop the spinning hands of the clock... and ask you one simple, yet profound question...

When was the last time you "closed your eyes"... not to fall asleep... not to rest your tired eyes after a long day of staring at a screen... but to close your eyes... in order to truly "see"?

When was the last time... you intentionally looked into that darkness... with the curiosity of a small child?

Alright... if you are ready... and are in a safe place... in a comfortable posture... whether sitting on a chair... or lying stretched out on a soft bed... I would like to invite you to try something with me... as a fellow traveler.

Gently... allow your eyelids... to relax... Feel the gravity that is gently inviting them to close... Don't force it... don't rush... Let them slowly descend... slowly... like velvet curtains in a theater gradually closing the scene...

As your eyelids meet... feel their gentle weight resting upon your eyes... Feel the hundreds of tiny muscles around your eyes slowly unwinding... releasing the tension they have held for so long... And in that very instant... the once bright and bustling outer world... fades away... leaving only you... with this private space that has just appeared... for a moment.

In this first moment, as the door to the outside world closes shut... what do you see?

For most people... perhaps including you... the answer that immediately comes to mind is... "darkness," "pitch black," or "emptiness."

It's a reasonable answer... because that is what we perceive instantly... But today... on our first journey... I want to invite you to look into that darkness once more... to look deeper than ever before... to look with attention... with the eyes of an explorer full of wonder... like an astronomer gazing into the far reaches of space... through the lens of the world's most powerful telescope... searching for a new star.

At first... there might still be only darkness... a blackness that seems endless... But please be patient for a moment... Don't be quick to judge... Don't look for anything in particular... Don't expect to see anything... Simply "be" with that darkness... get to know it... as if it were an old friend you haven't seen in a long time.

And soon... as your inner eye begins to adjust... you will start to notice... that it is not the dense, lifeless darkness you thought it was... but a canvas of jet-black silk, filled with astonishing details... There is movement... there is life...

Scientifically... what you are seeing is not emptiness, but the perception of light generated from within... without any external light hitting the eye. It's caused by the normal activity of cells in our visual nervous system... You could compare it to static in a system... or to put it more beautifully... it is our own "inner light"... the starlight of our inner universe.

Try to observe... You might start seeing tiny points of light that sparkle and then fade... flashing... then disappearing... like stardust in a distant galaxy... or like fireflies dancing in the dark of night... Sometimes they gather in clusters... forming faint shapes for a moment... Sometimes they scatter across the entire expanse... Try watching their silent dance... without trying to control or fixate on them... Just watch.

Or perhaps... you might see shadows moving slowly... like clouds at night drifting past the moon... They change shape continuously, with no fixed form... Sometimes they look like wisps of smoke curling from an incense stick... Sometimes they look like ripples expanding on a calm water surface... Watch their transformation... without trying to interpret what they are.

And if you are lucky... or perhaps I should say... if you are relaxed enough... you might see faint colors appear for a moment... and then slowly fade away... It could be a deep blue like the ocean at night... a faint green like the northern lights on the horizon... or a soft purple like lavender petals... These colors might be a reflection of the emotions lingering in your heart at that moment... a poem without words.

This is the frontier... the edge of the wonderful world that we all own... but have never thought to stop... and explore seriously.

And together, we will call this land... **"The World Behind the Eyelids."**

It is a private kingdom... where you are the sole ruler and inhabitant... A world we spend about a third of our lives in... every night we sleep... yet we know so little about it... less than we know the route from our home to our workplace.

We are used to using our eyes to look "outward"... to learn about people's stories... to admire the beauty of things... to escape from danger... But we are not used to using our "mind"... which is like another eye... to look "inward"... to perceive the stories of the inner world that constitutes our entire being.

Throughout our journey together in this podcast series... we will gradually take on the roles of explorers... adventurers... and cartographers... who will get to know this kingdom... with courage... patience... and most importantly... a child-like curiosity that doesn't judge anything in advance.

The only piece of equipment we need for this journey... is not a compass... not an old, folded map... but "awareness" or "mindfulness"... which is a precious treasure we all naturally possess... We just need to learn how to dust it off and use it... like sharpening a knife left to rust... or lighting a lamp in a room that has been dark for years.

In this first part of our journey... I won't invite you to walk deep into the dense forest or climb a steep mountain just yet... Let's just familiarize ourselves with the basic "terrain" of this world first... like setting up camp on a quiet beach... to acclimate to the new environment... to learn to appreciate the scenery before us.

Let your inner gaze... sweep across that dark sky once more... without trying to look for anything in particular... without trying to interpret what you see... Just be open to everything that appears... as it is... whether it's a faint point of light... a freely moving shadow... or even the seemingly empty, complete darkness... All of it is part of this landscape... a part of you.

Alright... now that we are becoming familiar with the image before us... I would like to invite you to switch from "seeing" to "hearing"... Try to shift your attention from your eyes... to your ears... Listen closely...

Not to the sounds from the outside world... not the sound of traffic on the street... not the chatter of people... not the hum of the air conditioner... but to the sounds from "within" your world... The sounds that have always been with you, but you may have never noticed.

What do you hear?

The first sound you might hear... when external silence arrives... is the sound of your own heartbeat... beating at a steady rhythm... Thump... thump... thump... Try listening to it... It's not just the sound of an organ at work... it is the sound of a sacred drum that our ancestors have listened to for millions of years... It is the rhythm of life... that firmly and steadily reminds us that we are still breathing... that we are alive in this very second... Try to follow its rhythm... feel its gentle vibration resonating throughout your body.

Then... try to listen a little more closely... let your attention expand... You will hear a softer, more continuous sound... the sound of your own breath... flowing in... and flowing out... in a never-ending cycle... Listen to its sound... It might be very quiet... like the sound of waves lapping the shore on a calm sea night... The in-breath... brings oxygen and freshness to nourish every cell in your body... The out-breath... releases fatigue and worries to float away with the air... The breath is the bridge that connects the outer world and the inner world... It is an anchor that helps us return to the present moment... no matter how fiercely the storm of emotions may rage.

And perhaps... in that deep silence... you might hear a faint ringing or hissing sound in your ears... a sound that many find annoying and try to escape from... But in this world behind the eyelids... we will try to change our perspective on it... We will not push it away... but will try to open our hearts and listen... Try to listen intently to that sound... listen as if it were background music... In some Eastern philosophies... this sound is called "the sound of silence"... Some say it is the frequency of our own nervous system... the fundamental sound of our being... that becomes clear when other noises in the world have quieted down... Listen to it... It may be a steady sound... or it may have highs and lows... Just perceive it... without judgment.

This is the soundtrack of this kingdom... a symphony of life that is always playing... but we have only just had the chance to be good listeners... and to listen to it intently for the first time.

Our journey today... has only just begun... We are still standing merely on the shore of this vast kingdom... getting to know the sky... the stars... and the background music...

But before us... lies a vast, unexplored continent... filled with dense forests of memory... valleys of fear... oceans of desire... and peaks of wisdom... where wondrous creatures live... and mysterious laws of nature await our discovery.

In the next episode... we will take the first step... off this safe shore... and walk deeper into the land... to get to know the first "creature" we will encounter... The most powerful creature in this world... It moves faster than the wind... changes its shape constantly... It can create the most beautiful palaces in an instant... and can also burn everything to the ground in a heartbeat... It can be the best friend who comforts... and the most vicious enemy who undermines us from within...

A creature we call... **"Thought."**

But for now... don't worry about that yet...

Just take the little time you have left... to rest here on the shore of the present moment... Familiarize yourself with the sky... the stars... and the music of the world behind the eyelids...

A world that is yours... and yours... alone... A world that is always waiting for your return...

See you again... on our next journey...
